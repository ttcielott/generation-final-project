## About
This software is designed for a cafe business owner with multiple offline stores. The client’s existing software only generates daily sales data for individual stores and does not provide a consolidated view of the entire business’s performance. This makes it difficult to gain valuable insights, such as customer targeting and best-selling products. Our software solves this problem by delivering an ETL pipeline that extracts sales data from the client’s sources, transforms it, and loads it into the client’s data warehouse, providing a comprehensive overview of the business’s performance.
<br>
> **Current Client Setup:**
- CSV file for each branch
- File Generation Time: 8 p.m
- Daily, Weekly, Montlhy Reports (on sales, other business metrics)
- Time-consuming Collation of all CSV files

> **Vision:**
- The new software should load CSV file on Cloud every night.
- The new software should have ETL pipeline.
- The new software should have monitoring system.

## Elevator Pitch

- **For** cafe business owner with multiple branches
- **who** wants to see the whole picture of their business <br>
- (targeting customers, the best-selling products, etc) in all branches <br>
- **the** new software <br>
- **is** a customer facing software <br>
- **that** allows customers to collate all data from each stores and gain valuable business insight in a timely manner<br>
- **unlike** the current software which is limited to sales tracking of one store at a time and data collation is time-consuming.<br>
- **our product** will allow customers to utilise their sales data to drive business growth.

## Database Schema

## Grafana Sales Dashboard

- After CSV files go through our ETL pipeline, the tranformed files are then stored in a Redshift DB
- We created a dashboard to enable the our client to view relevant information on the company's performance  

![Sales Dashboard](/Documentation/Grafana-sales.png)
- You can find JSON File for recreating this dashboard
  ```
  Documentation/Mocha Madness - Sales Dashboard.json
  ```
## Grafana Monitoing Dashboard
By querying log metrics in AWS Cloudwatch, we created the monitoring dashboard.
- In regards to how to set up grafana, please refer to the following document
  ```
  Documentation/final-project-grafana-setup.md
  ```
### AWS Lambda Function
- We monitor the number of invocations, throttle, errors, and duration.
- When there are numbers in errors, we go investigate the cause of the error in Cloudwatch and fix the issue.

### AWS SQS
- We keep track of any discrepancies in the number of messages sent, received, and deleted.
- We also monitor the number of messages in Dead Letter Queues that have been received by consumers more than 10 times but were not successfully processed and therefore not deleted.
